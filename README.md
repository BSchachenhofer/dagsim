# Simulating Hashgraph
This is the source code of the simulator developed and published during the work on the master thesis "On the Security of Proof-of-Stake Directed Acyclic Graph Protocols - A Simulation-Based Approach".
The simulator enables to simulate "The Swirlds Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm" (the basis of Hedera Hashgraph) under 3 different attack scenarios and the honest case for comparison.
It provides various configuration options, a graphical user interface as well as exporting the simulation results as text files. It is written in Kotlin.

More information can be found directly in the thesis (TU Vienna).
